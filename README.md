## Use Cases
</div>

### 1) Local Community Updates
A resident shares a neighborhood update as a public post, other members react/comment, and the discussion remains discoverable in the main feed.

### 2) Group-Scoped Coordination
A user posts updates only to a specific group (e.g., apartment block, volunteer team), keeping communication private to members.

### 3) Community Polling
A group admin or member creates a poll to make local decisions (event timing, priorities, actions), and members vote with transparent results.

### 4) Emergency Signaling
A user submits an urgent location-based report immediately from the map, enabling fast visibility for nearby community members.

### 5) Structured Incident Reporting
A user submits a detailed report with context, media, and location, then tracks progress and marks resolution when solved.

### 6) Nearby Assistance Discovery
During an incident, a user opens nearby service categories (hospital, police, fire, pharmacy) to quickly identify relevant help points.

### 7) Group Safety Coordination
Group members share their live location in group context, helping teams coordinate meetups, check-ins, or support response.

### 8) Member Onboarding & Trust
New users onboard with guided screens, verify email identity, and then join groups through moderated request workflows.

### 9) Lightweight Read-Only Exploration
A first-time visitor enters as a guest to explore feed/map content before creating an account.

### 10) Ongoing Group Administration
Group owners manage membership requests, monitor participation, and keep group communication organized through chat and moderation tools.
